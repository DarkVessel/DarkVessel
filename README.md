## Hello everyone, my name is Zhora üëã

I am studying Node programming.js with TypeScript. I am mainly engaged in Telegram and Discord bots, but recently I began to study web development. Unfortunately, I am still a student and I cannot devote all my free time to my occupation and I have no projects that I would like to show off. However, when they appear, I will definitely write them here!

### Studied technologies
I know all the basics of JavaScript (not browser-based) and write on the Node.js platform since about 2020. Around the beginning of the year, I started using the TypeScript compiler along with ESLint. In addition, I am studying:
- MySQL (SQL)
- HTML/CSS
- MongoDB
- Stylelint
- Docker
- Python
- bash

### Where can I be found?
I am in various messengers and social networks. The main ones are:
- Mastodon (Russian blog): https://social.linux.pizza/@katze
- Telegram: https://t.me/katze_942
- Discord: `–ê–≥–µ–Ω—Ç-–ñ–æ—Ä—Ä–∞ 942#2008` (ID: `517331770656686080`)
- Matrix: `@katze-942:matrix.org`
- GMail: rs5334819@gmail.com

### Additionally
I am also on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/DarkVessel/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChoAy5_itTHfsngdbRFhRvw)! For any questions, you can write to me in private messages, I don't bite. In my free time, I will finish all my projects.

Good morning, evening or night to you.
